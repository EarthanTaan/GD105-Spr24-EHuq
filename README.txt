 GD105 a computer art class using Processing

Section A1

R1 A reproduction of Nassos Daphnis' artwork "SS-1-78" (1978).
This uses only the line function and a few variables to keep things aligned.

R2 A reproduction of Kamal Boullata's  artwork "Lam Alif" (1983).
Similar to R1 but with more shapes and colors.

R3 An artistic rendition of one of Jenny Holzer's "Truisms".
Uses an unusual frame dimension to accentuate the discomfort of the words displayed at awkward angles. Aethetically evokes a financial institution, but altered to be mildly hostile to the reader.

R4 A map of my bookbag and the organization of items therein. Exceedingly simple. Deliberately low-resolution, but I don't think it works in the end. Dissatisfied with this piece.

R5 An imaginary album cover for the original soundtrack to a real video game.
Took me way too long, but very pleased with the result. I had the image in mind first, and attached it to an album second. The chessboard is also a tome, the game has three kings which is one too many, and between all of them is a crucial pawn (the game's protagonist).

Section A2

R1 A collage comprised of a lot of random images.
I tried to replicate the experience of taking whatever I could find in random magazines and putting them together in an image that reads even if it doesn't say anything. I feel that I succeeded. Artist's note: The train is meant to be exiting the woman's mouth, as if she is spitting or vomiting it out. I don't know that I succeeded at communicating that, but I tried.

R2 Produces randomized spirographs in a random but limited color range. The background is not quite black, in order for darker spiro-shapes to be visible and create greater depth. The spiro-shapes are not perfectly symmetrical, which was an accident, but one I chose not to correct because I enjoy the effect.

R3 This is a beating heart, which beats faster the closer the mouse cursor gets to it. A dull red warning flashes when the user gets too close, and if they click the heart it will break. A rare case where I went in with a clear vision and was able to execute on it.

R4 A perfectly looping gif which illustrates a cartoonishly stylized grandfather clock in a nondescript but welcoming hallway. The clock is maybe posessed. It is a perfect loop at 63 frames, running at 50 frames per second. Another clear vision executed as expected. I might be getting the hang of this.
