/*A useful map of some kind.
Think about what kind of map is useful to you. Where do you use maps in your everyday life?
What do you wish maps did that they donâ€™t currently?

Living maps using GPS are what are useful to me because I have directional dyslexia.
I use the map on my phone almost every day. Besides that, there are diagrams for baby products.
The mental map of my home, I guess? The Hostos campus map. Idk I'm kinda stumped on this one.
