/* For the Clock, to illustrate that time is fleeting, how about a descending count of
seconds remaining in the year? I don't think the computer clock holds this data, so I'll
need to cobble it together from what the clock does say. I assume this will require me to 
construct a sort of code abacus that tacks a set number of seconds onto the total based one
the month and date. */
