/* This calender renders the current date as a color. Month, week, and day will be represented
by hue, saturation, and maybe brightness. (Which for which remains to be determined.) 
This will create a calendar with much less clearly defined borders between units of time, 
producing a tool which deliberately obfuscates precision instead of providing it. */
